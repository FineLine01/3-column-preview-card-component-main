### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {
   .three-columns {
    display:flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    }

    .sedans-box {
        border-radius: 7px 7px 0 0;
    }

    .luxury-box {
        border-radius: 0 0 7px 7px;
    }
}
```

### Continued development
In the future may be added responsiveness to more sizes of screens.
